# PLACES Implementation

## Overview

This repository provides an implementation of the PLACES framework. PLACES is designed to model and analyze structured patterns in data using probabilistic latent approaches. The implementation is presented in an easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook format, making it accessible for research, experimentation, and educational use.

## Repository Structure

- PLACES_implementation.ipynb: Main notebook containing the core implementation of the PLACES framework.
- PLACES_future_enhancements.ipynb: Supplementary notebook listing potential directions for further development and improvement.

## Installation

To set up this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nihamo/PLACES-implementation.git
   cd PLACES-implementation
   

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   

3. Install dependencies:
   If a requirements.txt file is not provided, install the libraries manually:
   bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   

## Usage

To explore and run the implementation:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook
   

2. Open the file PLACES_implementation.ipynb and run the cells sequentially to understand or modify the model.
3. Optionally, explore PLACES_future_enhancements.ipynb for ideas on extending the framework.
